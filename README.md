# h2c-rewriter-haproxy

HAProxy ingress annotation rewriter for [helmfile2compose](https://github.com/helmfile2compose/helmfile2compose) — translates `haproxy.org/*` Ingress annotations into reverse proxy entries. Also serves as the default fallback rewriter for unclassified Ingress resources.

**The Herald** — one of the Eight Monks, the founding extensions of the helmfile2compose distribution.

> Heresy level: 2/10 — announces what others have decreed, translates annotations into action.
